#App Source code
The application consists of 4 Activities (Main, statistics, options and the game itself)
For Each of the activities there is a layout xml file and a java file and there is an additional java file that contains the constants used through the application (MyContsants.java)

Tha main part of the application is the GameBoard.java that's where all the magic happens
the GameBoard.java file, where the minimax is implemeted and the core of the game (actually the game itself) is written, is fairly good documented (The best commenting I've done so far) and all of the other activities' code is pretty much basic android stuff (saving and retrieving statistics, setting difficulty and so..)
